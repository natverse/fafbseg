## Background

We need cloudvolume and meshparty for python in order to get flywire meshes. This help article is written for those with not much experience using python.
For more experienced users, see cloud-volume install and basic command info [here](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume).

If you are new to python, especially to `pip`, and `conda`, this [blog post](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) can be helpful in understanding what's what.

Bottomline is that `conda` can install python and non-python software to a specific environment, trying to keep that environment functional by taking different dependencies of packages into consideration, while `pip` installs only python packages to wherever you want, whatever you tell it to install. In general there are more packages that you can `pip` install (from PyPi), but you can also do this in a `conda` environment without a problem in most cases.

Since there are a bunch of non-python dependencies for **cloud-volume** and **meshparty** , `conda` looks better for what we want.

## Install conda

[Download](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) **miniconda** and install it, this includes only `conda`, python, and a few very basic packages, including `pip`:

Make sure you know where you install it (e.g. usually here: `/opt/miniconda3`), and update it to the most recent version in the Terminal:

```$ conda update conda```

Hit 'y' to proceed if prompted.

After this the default python is `/opt/miniconda3/bin/python`, you can check with

```$ which python```

## Work with a new environment

Use **conda** to create and activate an environment where we can install everything we need:

```
$ conda create --name flywire_env python=3.7
$ conda activate flywire_env
$ conda install nomkl
```

(To deactivate an active environment, use `$ conda deactivate flywire_env`)

At this point we are in our environment and we can use `conda install <package_name>` simply for anything that's available [here](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo), and `pip` should also install packages in this environment, unless your PATH variable in your bash.profile file tells it otherwise. Check which `pip` is default:

```$ which pip```

This should give you something under your miniconda folder, like `/opt/miniconda3/envs/flywire_env/bin/pip`. 

However, you might have your system python's `pip`. You can comment out the PATH variable for python in your .bash.profile by running:

```$ touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile```

and adding a `#` before lines `PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin:${PATH}"` and `export PATH`. After this `which pip` will return the right thing, same thing applies to `which python`. 

Alternatively you can always specify in the terminal which `pip` you want to use, but this is suboptimal (e.g. `/opt/miniconda3/envs/flywire_env/bin/pip install cloud-volume`).

## Install cloudvolume

Now we can install **cloud-volume** with

```$ pip install cloud-volume```

You will need a compiler (XCode on Mac) to install everything. If you don't have XCode, you either need to update your OSX to the most recent version to download it from AppStore, or you can get any version compatible with your current system from here: https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/

We have not tried installing on Windows, try to get the right compiler with help from Google. In the thread on [FlyWire Slack](https://flywire-forum.slack.com/archives/CM86C8H7F/p1570470089014000) you might find other useful things.

To use **cloud-volume**, you need to get a token for authorisation here: https://globalv1.flywire-daf.com/auth/api/v1/refresh_token, and add this to a `.json` file that you create in this location: `~/.cloudvolume/secrets/chunkedgraph-secret.json`, see help for this [here](http://natverse.org/fafbseg/articles/articles/accessing-graphene-server.html).


## Install meshparty

Install **meshparty**:

```$ pip install meshparty```

This errored out for me with a failure to install the dependency: **pykdtree** `clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'`. This is an issue with my gcc compiler version (probably), good thing we're using `conda` now so we can do:

```$ conda install -c conda-forge pykdtree```

After this `pip` installing **meshparty** worked fine with the previous command.

Now we have both **meshparty** and **cloud-volume** in this environment, but **meshparty** has a few more optional dependencies for skeletonisation, that we need to install:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge pyembree
$ pip install annotationframeworkclient
```

In order to use `meshparty_skeletonisation` I also had to install **PyChunkedGraph**, which has a dependency called **igneous**, both are from the Seung lab.

Install **igneous** from GitHub, and then `pip` install **PyChunkedGraph**:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:seung-lab/igneous.git
$ cd igneous
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py develop
$ pip install PyChunkedGraph
```

## Working with R and python

If we want to use these packages in `R` through reticulate with all the **natverse** and **fafbseg** functions and objects then we need to have the package **reticulate** in `R` (`install.packages("reticulate")`) and tell it to use this python version in our `conda` environment. 

Run in `R` console:`usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add the line `RETICULATE_PYTHON="/opt/miniconda3/envs/flywire_env/bin/python"` with your path to the python under the `conda` environment. Be sure to leave a blank line at the end of the file.

Restart R session, load **reticulate** and **fafbseg** (if necessary install/update with `remotes::install_github("jefferis/fafbseg")`. Check your python version with `reticulate::py_config()`, it should show the same path what you gave to the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` variable.

It is possible that your RStudio session will crash with `reticulate::py_config()`. This may be because multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. To fix, try:

```
$ conda uninstall numpy scikit-learn
$ conda install nomkl numpy scikit-learn
$ conda remove mkl mkl-service
```

### The natverse and flywire meshes

Let's set up R to look at the write flywire data. You need to have access to the production node of the flywire environment (i.e. passed the test).

Use `usethis::edit_r_profile`, and in your R profile add:

```
# Production flywire
options(fafbseg.cloudvolume.url='graphene://https://prodv1.flywire-daf.com/segmentation/1.0/fly_v31')
```

After this you should be able to read meshes, skeletonise them, and plot both with FAFB:

```
# Load packages
library(natverse)
library(fafbseg)
choose_segmentation("flywire")
dir.create("flywire_skeletons")

# Points in FAFBv14 (nm) to flywire coordinates (also nm)
points = matrix(c(723086,200499,90960),ncol=3)
flywire.fafb = xform_brain(points, sample='FAFB14', ref="FlyWire")

# Get mesh
id = flywire_xyz2id(flywire.fafb)
neuron_mesh = read_cloudvolume_meshes(id)

# Skeletonise mesh
meshparty_skeletonize(id, savedir = "flywire_skeletons")
neuron_skel <- read.neuron.swc(sprintf("flywire_skeletons/%s.swc",id))

nopen3d()
plot3d(FAFB, alpha = 0.1)
plot3d(neuron_skel*1000, WithNodes = F, col = "red", lwd = 2)
wire3d(neuron_mesh[[1]], col = "cyan", alpha = 0.2)
```

### Skeletor

You may also want to install [skeletor](https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor), a package from Philipp Schlegel that helps you thin and skeletonise meshes yourself. This can produce more accurate results than you get using [TEASAR](https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCGA.2000.883951) through meshparty, and does not depend on either. To install, do:

```
$ source activate flywire_env
$ conda install nomkl
$ pip3 install git+git://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor@master
$ pip3 install fastremap
$ pip3 install ncollpyde
```
You could test that skeletor works for flywire neurons in python using:

```
python
from cloudvolume import CloudVolume
import trimesh as tm
import skeletor as sk
id=720575940614134045
vol = CloudVolume('graphene://https://prodv1.flywire-daf.com/segmentation/1.0/fly_v31', use_https=True)
m = vol.mesh.get(id, deduplicate_chunk_boundaries=False)[id]
m = tm.Trimesh(m.vertices, m.faces)
simp = sk.simplify(m, ratio=.1)
cntr = sk.contract(simp, SL=10, WH0=2, iter_lim=4, epsilon=0.05, precision=1e-6, progress=False, operator='umbrella')
swc = sk.skeletonize(cntr, method='vertex_clusters', sampling_dist=500, progress=False)
swc = sk.clean(swc, simp)
swc['radius'] = sk.radii(swc, simp, method='knn', n=5, aggregate='mean')
print(swc)
```

Once you have installed skeletor and specified your python environment as described above, in R you should be able to do:

```
# Skeletonise
choose_segmentation("flywire")
nx=xform_brain(elmr::dense_core_neurons, ref="FlyWire", sample="FAFB14")
xyz =xyzmatrix(nx)
ids = unique(flywire_xyz2id(xyz[sample(1:nrow(xyz),100),]))
neurons = skeletor(ids)

# Plot in 3D
nopen3d()
plot3d(neurons) # note, in flywire space, slightly different to FAFBv14 space
plot3d(nx, col="black", lwd  =2) # note, in flywire space
```

### Issues

If you run into issues, you can try wiping and re-initiating your conda environment. You can try without igneous and PyChunkedGraph. You may also need to specify installing cloudvolume at version 1.20.1, though you should really use the latest versions of cloudvolume if you can.

For example:

```
$ conda remove -n flywire_env --all
$ conda create --name flywire_env python=3.7
$ conda activate flywire_env
$ conda install nomkl
$ conda install -c conda-forge pykdtree
$ pip install meshparty cloud-volume~=1.20.1
$ pip3 install git+git://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor@master
$ pip3 install fastremap
$ pip3 install ncollpyde
```
