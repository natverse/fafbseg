## Find the distance between meshes

There are two ways that I can immediately think of addressing this

1. Find the distance of every vertex on mesh 1 to its nearest neighbour
on mesh 2
2. Find the (signed) distance from every vertex of mesh 1 to the surface of mesh 2

Obviously the ideal situation would be to find the mesh to mesh distances for
the two objects (or even do a Euclidean distance transform on the voxel 
representation of the objects.) but neither of those are so accessible. 

Option 1 is probably still a perfectly good option for most purposes since the
meshes are quite densely sampled (i.e. the vertices are close together).

## Setup and Mesh volume

Let's use the same example that I mentioned on FlyWire slack.

```{r}
library(fafbseg)
choose_segmentation("flywire31")
va6pn=read_cloudvolume_meshes("720575940633169983")
```

There we were asked to find the volume of a mesh. The first attempt fails

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rvcg::vcgVolume(va6pn[[1]])
```

So we need to clean up the mesh:

```{r}
va6pn.clean=Rvcg::vcgClean(va6pn[[1]], sel=0:6, iterate = T)
vol=Rvcg::vcgVolume(va6pn.clean)
```

```{r}
vol
# cubic microns 
vol/1e9 
```

### Compare with neuron's skeleton available from VFB catmaid

```{r}
library(elmr)
fafbconn=vfbcatmaid("fafb")
va6pn.skel=read.neurons.catmaid("name:VA6.*PN", conn=fafbconn)
summary(va6pn.skel)
```

```{r}
cable.length=summary(va6pn.skel)[1,"cable.length"]
vol/cable.length # in nm
vol/cable.length/1e6 # in µm
```

```{r}
A=vol/cable.length/1e6 # mean area µm2
sqrt(A/(2*pi)) # implied radius µm, seems reasonable
```

## Option 1: Vertex to vertex distance

So let's try and find the vertex to vertex distance for a pair of neurons. We
happen to know that this lateral horn local interneuron is a
target of the VA6 PN.

```{r}
pv4b4=read_cloudvolume_meshes('720575940619630430')
```

Now we can use a [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) 
to find the nearest neighbour distances very efficiently. Note also the use
of the [`xyzmatrix`](http://natverse.org/nat/reference/xyzmatrix.html) function
to extract vertex locations - this works for all objects that the natverse knows about.

```{r}
# better to make the tree from the larger object 
# and query using points from the smaller object
nvertices(pv4b4)
nvertices(va6pn)
kd=nabor::knn(query = xyzmatrix(pv4b4), data=xyzmatrix(va6pn), k=1)
str(kd)
```

This gives us:

1. a set of vertex indices for the closest match on the VA6 PN for
every vertex on the LHLN 
2. the distances to those matching vertices

We can take a look at the distribution of the distances like so:

```{r}
hist(kd$nn.dists, br=100)
```

You can see that there are actually quite a lot of close distances.

```{r}
hist(kd$nn.dists, br=500, xlim=c(0,2000))
```

and I assume that the excess of distances <1000 nm where there is a little
dip in the distribution is related to this being a pair of neurons that are
actually synaptically connected.

### Locations of closest approach

OK. So where do those meshes actually approach each other. Well we could look at
the locations of the very closest distances <100 nm. How many are there?

```{r}
sum(kd$nn.dists<100)
```

Still a lot! This is because at a location of close approach between the neurons,
there will be multiple vertices that are very close together. Separating out 
these distinct contact locations is a more complex problem than simply calculating
all of these vertex distances. The first thing we could do is throw out cases
where the same vertex on the target neuron is a match.

```{r}
length(unique(kd$nn.idx[kd$nn.dists<100]))
```
Looks like that would reduce by a third.

### Visualising contacts 
Let's just take a quick detour and see what the close approaches look like:

```{r}
rgl::setupKnitr()
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
nopen3d()
plot3d(pv4b4, type='wire')
plot3d(va6pn, col='red', type='wire')
spheres3d(xyzmatrix(pv4b4)[kd$nn.dists<100,], col='green', r=500)
```

Show close nodes on the query mesh
```{r, eval=FALSE}
nclear3d()
plot3d(pv4b4, col=ifelse(kd$nn.dists<100, 'red', 'black'))
plot3d(va6pn, col='grey')
```

Just the query mesh
```{r, eval=FALSE}
nclear3d()
plot3d(pv4b4, col=ifelse(kd$nn.dists<100, 'red', 'black'), type='wire')
```

### Identifying discrete contact zones

There are a range of ways this could be done, essentially what we have is a 
number of local minima in the distance field to find. It might also be the case
that one "patch" on one neuron actually matches several patches on the other
neuron. However we'll just try to pick a simpler approach as an example.

Let's take the points below threshold distance on the query neuron and find
the geodesic distance (i.e. the distance along the mesh surface) between them.

We need to do a bit of prep work for this, to make a graph representation of the
mesh.

```{r}
#' Make an igraph representation of the edge network of a mesh object
#'
#' @param x A \code{mesh3d} object or an object for which an \code{as.mesh3d}
#'   method is defined. As a convenience the first mesh object is extracted when
#'   \code{x} is a \code{shapelist3d} object.
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to \code{as.mesh3d}
#'
#' @return a \code{igraph} object whose vertices correspond to the vertices of the
#'   original mesh object and whose edges have weights matching the edge lengths
#'   in the mesh.
#' @export
mesh2graph <- function(x, ...) {
  if(inherits(x, 'shapelist3d')) x=x[[1]]
  if(inherits(x, 'neuronlist')) x=x[[1]]
  if(!inherits(x, 'mesh3d')) x=as.mesh3d(x, ...)
  if(nrow(x$it)!=3) stop("I only work for triangulat meshes right now")
  
  # make the edge list
  v1=x$it[1,]
  v2=x$it[2,]
  v3=x$it[3,]
  el=rbind(cbind(v1,v2), cbind(v1,v3), cbind(v2,v3))
  g=igraph::graph_from_edgelist(el, directed = FALSE)
  
  # calculate lengths of each edge
  xyz=xyzmatrix(x)
  edgelengths = function(v1, v2) {
    deltas=xyz[v1,,drop=F]-xyz[v2,,drop=F]
    sqrt(rowSums(deltas^2))
  }
  weights=c(edgelengths(v1,v2), edgelengths(v1,v3), edgelengths(v2,v3))
  igraph::E(g)$weight=weights
  g
}
```

Convert the LHLN to this mesh representation
```{r}
g=mesh2graph(pv4b4)
```

Now we can find the geodesic distance between all selected nodes.
```{r}
dmat=igraph::distances(g, v=which(kd$nn.dists<100), to = which(kd$nn.dists<100))
```

Let's try clustering that distance matrix
```{r}
dd=hclust(as.dist(dmat))
plot(dd, labels = F)
```


```{r, rgl=TRUE}
# cut using a height relating to a separation of 3000nm
groups=cutree(dd, h=3000)
# sample randomises colours so that neighbouring clusters have different colours
set.seed(42)
groupcols=sample(rainbow(max(groups)))[groups]

nclear3d()
spheres3d(xyzmatrix(pv4b4)[kd$nn.dists<100,], col=groupcols, rad=200)
wire3d(pv4b4[[1]], col=ifelse(kd$nn.dists<100, 'red', 'black'), type='wire')
```
