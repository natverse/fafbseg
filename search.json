#9F8CF1, #FFFFFF, 353067, DNge005 was merged into DNge172, #59CB74, #FFFFFF, 612500, best match in male is P1_17a and P1_17b, #89D2EA, #FFFFFF, 93999, uncertain match to LM, #F4667C, #FFFFFF, 278525,

The training data was assembled from annotations by Selden Koolman, Merlin Moore, Sarah Morejohn, Ben Silverman, Kyle Willie, Ryan Willie, Szi-chieh Yu and Shang Mu.\\n\\nAs this data was generated using a 2D, rather than 3D, neural network, defects are present in the detected nuclei, particularly where there are large defects in section alignment or a number of consecutive missing sections.\\n\\nFalse positive fragments, nucleus fragments and partial nuclei are the most common type of defects. A simple, rudimentary method for cleaning up is to disregard small fragments by thresholding by segment size or by the z-dimension of the bounding boxes. A size threshold of 2000 voxels (0.08 μm3) was already applied in producing this segmentation.\\n\\nA minimal number of nucleus merger instances have been observed, caused by section alignment defects or close nuclei appositions in certain non-neuronal cell clusters.\\n\\nWhen using the nucleus annotations, please acknowledge Shang Mu and let him know about your use case.\\n\\nWe encourage making (and using) improvements to this data based on the information provided (for example, utilizing bounding box dimensions and/or the segmentation to find and merge incorrectly split partial nuclei), and such improvements should be discussed with Shang.
