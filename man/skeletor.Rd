\arguments{
\item{segments}{The segment ids to fetch (probably as a character vector),
e.g. flywire IDs or hemibrain bodyids. Meshes are read from the specified
CloudVolume (\code{cloudvolume.url}).}

\item{obj}{character. Path of a \code{obj} file or a folder of such files.
These files are read as meshes and then skeletonised. If \code{segments} is
given, this argument is overridden.}

\item{mesh3d}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then the neuron's volume is added to
each \code{neuron} object in the resultant \code{neuronlist]} at
\code{neuron$mesh3d}.}

\item{save.obj}{character. Path to which to save \code{.obj} file for neuron
volumes. If \code{NULL}, .obj files are not saved (default).}

\item{cloudvolume.url}{Optional url from which to fetch meshes normally
specified by the \code{fafbseg.cloudvolume.url} option.}

\item{operator}{Which Laplacian operator to use for mesh contraction.
\code{"contangent"} takes topology and geometry of the mesh into account
and so is a better descriptor of curvature flow. The \code{"umbrella"},
'uniform weighting' operator uses only topological features, making it more
robust to mesh flaws.}

\item{clean}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then, in python,
\code{skeletor.post.clean_up} is used to collapse twigs that have line of
sight to each other and move nodes outside the mesh back inside. Note that
this is not a magic bullet and some of this will not work (well) if the
original mesh was degenerate (e.g. internal faces or not watertight) to
begin with. You will need to have the \code{ncollpyde} python3 module
installed. You can get this with \code{pip3 install ncollpyde}. If you get
issues related to this module, best to set this to \code{FALSE}.
\code{skeletor.pre.fix_mesh} is also used to remove seemingly erroneous
vertices and remove other common mesh problems.}

\item{remove_disconnected, }{integer or 'False'. If a number is given and
\code{clean==TRUE},\ will iterate over the mesh's connected components and
remove those consisting of less than the given number of vertices. For
example, ``remove_fragments=5`` will drop parts of the mesh that consist of
five or less connected vertices.}

\item{theta}{numeric. Used if \code{clean=TRUE}. For each twig we generate
the dot product between the tangent vectors of it and its parents. If these
line up perfectly the dot product will equal 1. \code{theta} determines how
much that value can differ from 1 for us to still prune the twig: higher
theta = more pruning.}

\item{radius}{logical. Whether or not to return radius information for each
skeleton node. If you want to make use of radii, you will need to have the
\code{ncollpyde} python3 module installed. You can get this with \code{pip3
install ncollpyde}. If you get issues related to this module, best to set
this to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ratio}{numeric, 0-1. Factor to which to reduce mesh faces. For example,
a ratio of 0.5 will reduce the number of faces to 50 percent.}

\item{SL}{numeric. Factor by which the contraction matrix is multiplied for
each iteration. In theory, lower values are more likely to get you an
optimal contraction at the cost of needing more iterations.}

\item{WH0}{numeric. Initial weight factor for the attraction constraints. The
ratio of the initial weights \code{WL0} (\code{1e-3 * sqrt(A)}) and
\code{WH0} controls the smoothness and the degree of contraction of the
first iteration result, thus it determines the amount of details retained
in subsequent and final contracted meshes.}

\item{iter_lim}{integer. Maximum rounds of contractions.}

\item{epsilon}{numeric. Target contraction rate as measured by the sum of all
face areas in the contracted versus the original mesh. Algorithm will stop
once mesh is contracted below this threshold. Depending on your mesh
(number of faces, shape) reaching a strong contraction can be extremely
costly with comparatively little benefit for the subsequent
skeletonisation. Note that the algorithm might stop short of this target if
\code{iter_lim} is reached first or if the sum of face areas is increasing
from one iteration to the next instead of decreasing.}

\item{precision}{numeric. Sets the precision for finding the least-square
solution. This is the main determinant for speed vs quality: lower values
will take (much) longer but will get you closer to an optimally contracted
mesh. Higher values will be faster but the iterative contractions might
stop early.}

\item{validate}{If \code{True}, will try to fix potential issues with the
mesh (e.g. infinite values, duplicate vertices, degenerate faces) before
collapsing. Degenerate meshes can lead to effectively infinite runtime for
this function!}

\item{method.radii}{the method by which to determine each node's radius.
\code{"knn"} uses k-nearest-neighbours to get radii: fast but potential for
being very wrong. \code{"ray"} uses ray-casting to get radii: slower but
sometimes less wrong.}

\item{method}{Skeletonisation comes in two flavours with different Pros and
Cons. \code{"vertex_clusters"} groups and collapses vertices based on their
geodesic distance along the mesh's surface. It's fast and scales well but
can lead to oversimplification. Good for quick & dirty skeletonisations.
\code{"edge_collapse"} implements skeleton extraction by edge collapse
described Au et al. 2008. It's rather slow and doesn't scale well but is
really good at preserving topology.}

\item{heal}{logical. Whether or not, if the neuron id fragmented, to stitch
multiple fragments into single neuron using minimum spanning tree.}

\item{heal.k}{integer. The number of nearest neighbours to consider when
trying to merge different clusters.}

\item{heal.threshold}{numeric. The threshold distance above which new
vertices will not be connected (default=\code{Inf} disables this feature).
This parameter prevents the merging of vertices that are so far away from
the main neuron that they are likely to be spurious.}

\item{reroot}{logical. Whether or not to re-root the neuron at an estimated
'soma'. A soma is usually a large ball in the neuron, which will
skeletonise into something of a hair ball. We can try to detect it quickly
and reroot the skeleton there. We do this by finding the nearest leaf nodes
to each leaf node, and seeing if they are going off in divergent
directions.}

\item{k.soma.search}{integer. The number of leaf nodes to find, around each
leaf node of radius \code{radius.soma.search}, for the rerooting process.
The larger the number, the better but slower.}

\item{radius.soma.search}{numeric. The distance within which to search for
fellow leaf nodes for the rerooting process. Will be inaccurate at values
that are too high or too low. Should be about the size of the expected
soma.}

\item{reroot_method}{whether to try to reroot the neuron based on
mixed direction of vectors in the neuron at nearby point('direction') or
proximity of points alone ('density').}

\item{brain}{a \code{mesh3d} or \code{hxsurf} object within which a soma
cannot occur. For the re-rooting process. (Insect somata tend to lie
outside the brain proper)}

\item{n}{For \code{method.radii = "knn"}. Radius will be the mean over
\code{n} nearest-neighbours.}

\item{n_rays}{integer. For \code{method.radii = "knn"}.For \code{method.radii
= "ray"}. Number of rays to cast for each node.}

\item{projection}{For \code{method.radii = "ray"}. Whether to cast rays in a
sphere around each node or in a circle orthogonally to the node's tangent
vector.}

\item{fallback}{For \code{method.radii = "ray"}. If a point is outside or
right on the surface of the mesh the ray casting will return nonsense
results. We can either ignore those cases (\code{"None"}), assign a
arbitrary number or we can fall back to radii from k-nearest-neighbours
(\code{"knn"}).}

\item{waves}{integer. For \code{method = "wavefront"}. Number of waves to run
across the mesh. Each wave is initialised at a different vertex which
produces slightly different rings. The final skeleton is produced from a
mean across all waves. More waves produce higher resolution skeletons but
also introduce more noise.}

\item{step_size}{integer, Values greater 1 effectively lead to binning of
rings. For example a stepsize of 2 means that two adjacent vertex rings
will be collapsed to the same center. This can help reduce noise in the
skeleton (and as such counteracts a large number of waves)}

\item{sampling_dist}{numeric. For \code{method = "vertex_clusters"}. Maximal
distance at which vertices are clustered. This parameter should be tuned
based on the resolution of your mesh.}

\item{cluster_pos}{numeric. For \code{method = "vertex_clusters"}. How to
determine the x/y/z coordinates of the collapsed vertex clusters (i.e. the
skeleton's nodes). \code{"median"}: Use the vertex closest to cluster's
centrer of mass. \code{"center"}: Use the center of mass. This makes for
smoother skeletons but can lead to nodes outside the mesh.}

\item{shape_weight}{numeric. For \code{method = "edge_collapse"}. Weight for
shape costs which penalize collapsing edges that would drastically change
the shape of the object.}

\item{sample_weight}{numeric.For \code{method = "edge_collapse"}. Weight for
sampling costs which penalise collapses that would generate prohibitively
long edges.}

\item{inv_dist}{numeric.For \code{method = "teasar"}. Distance along the mesh
used for invalidation of vertices. This controls how detailed (or noisy)
the skeleton will be.}

\item{cpu}{double (of length one). Set a limit on the total cpu time in
seconds.}

\item{elapsed}{double (of length one). Set a limit on the total elapsed cpu
time in seconds}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{reticulate::py_run_string}.}

\item{x}{a \code{nat::neuron} object.}
}
\value{
A \code{nat::neuronlist} containing neuron skeleton objects.

\description{
You can skeletonise complex neuron meshes using skeletor
  \href{https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor}{skeletor-1.0.0}. Skeletor is a
  python library and this function wraps a series of skeletor functions in
  order to smoothly process neurons for use with the
  \href{http://natverse.org/}{natverse}. Note, the default settings optimise
  performance for fast skeletonisation of
  \href{https://ngl.flywire.ai}{flywire} meshes. For casual users we
  recommend using the 'wave' method, which is fast and simple in terms of
  parameters, i.e. it just uses \code{waves} and \code{step_size}. A value of
  1 for both often works well.
}
\details{
This pipeline:

  1. Reads specified meshes from a CloudVolume source.

  2. Simplifies each mesh (python: \code{skeletor.pre.simplify})

  3. Contract the mesh (python: \code{skeletor.pre.contract})

  4. Skeletonises the mesh (python: \code{skeletor.skeletonize})

  5. Optionally, cleans the mesh (python: \code{skeletor.post.clean_up})

  6. Optionally, add radius information to the skeleton (python:
  \code{skeletor.post.radii})

  7. Optionally, heal the skeleton if there are breaks
  (\code{nat::stitch_neurons_mst})

  8. Optionally, attempts to re-root the neuron at a 'hairball', i.e.
  approximate the soma (\code{reroot_hairball}).

  You will therefore need to have a working python3 install of skeletor,
  which uses CloudVolume. You do not require meshparty. Please install the
  Python skeletor module as described at:
  \url{https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor}. You must ensure that you are
  using python3 (implicitly or explicitly) as mesh fetching from graphene
  servers depends on this. This should normally work: \code{pip3 install
  git+git://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor@master}. If you have already
  installed skeletor but it is not found, then I recommend editing your
  \code{\link{Renviron}} file to set an environment variable pointing to the
  correct Python. You can do this with \code{usethis::edit_r_environ()} and
  then setting e.g. \code{RETICULATE_PYTHON="/usr/local/bin/python3"}.
  (Though best practice would be to create a conda environment for your
  natverse R sessions and direct R there using your environ file.)

  You will need to set up some kind of authentication in order to fetch
  volume data for skeletonisation. See
  \url{https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume#chunkedgraph-secretjson} for
  how to get a token and where to save it. You can either save a json snippet
  to \code{~/.cloudvolume/secrets/cave-secret.json} or set an
  environment variable (\code{CHUNKEDGRAPH_SECRET="XXXX"}.

  Finally you will also need to set an option pointing to your server. This
  is the server hosting the mesh data you are interested in. This might look
  something like:
  \code{options(fafbseg.cloudvolume.url='graphene://https://xxx.dynamicannotationframework.com/segmentation/xxx/xxx')}
   and you can easily add this to your startup \code{\link{Rprofile}} with
  \code{usethis::edit_r_profile()}. For example, for the flywire data set, it
  is currently:
  \code{'graphene://https://prodv1.flywire-daf.com/segmentation/1.0/fly_v31'}.


  Roughly in decreasing order of impact on speed:

  Ratio: lower ratio = less vertices = faster

  epsilon: lower target contraction rate = less steps = faster

  SL: faster contraction = pot. less steps to target contraction rate =
  faster

  precision: lower precision = faster least-square computation = faster

  sampling_dist: larger dist = faster collapse of mesh into skeleton = faster
