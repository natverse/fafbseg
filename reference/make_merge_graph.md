# Graph representation of the agglomeration (merge) between raw segments

`make_merge_graph` generates a graph representation of all agglomeration
merges.

`merge_graph_components` uses the full merge graph to find each
connected subgraph corresponding to isolated merge groups.

## Usage

``` r
make_merge_graph(x, n = NA)

merge_graph_components(g, n = NA)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  The `mergeinfo` `data.frame` generated by
  [`read_mergeinfo`](https://natverse.org/fafbseg/reference/read_mergeinfo.md)

- n:

  For testing purposes, the number of rows of merge information to
  process - the default processes all rows.

- g:

  Either a graph generated by `make_merge_graph` or the `mergeinfo`
  `data.frame` generated by
  [`read_mergeinfo`](https://natverse.org/fafbseg/reference/read_mergeinfo.md).

## Value

`make_merge_graph` returns an `igraph` object, `merge_graph_components`
returns a list with elements describing the mapping between segment ids
and merge groups.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
g=make_merge_graph(mergeinfo)
gc=merge_graph_components(g)
str(gc)
} # }
```
